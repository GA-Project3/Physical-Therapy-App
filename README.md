##Scope

####Goal
Allow the user and the physician to communicate and interact online. Physician will be able to assign exercises to patients undergoing physical therapy via digital media (pictures/gif, videos, descriptions).

##User Stories

There are two users: patient and doctor.

#####Patient
The patient will be able to log in/sign up,  view the doctors, choose a doctor, view the list of exercises prescribed by the doctor, and view the overall exercise index page
 
#####Doctors
The physician will be able to log in/sign up, to view the patient profile, assign/remove the exercises to the patient

We'll have three models: patients,  doctors and exercises. The patient and exercises are connected by a joint table
