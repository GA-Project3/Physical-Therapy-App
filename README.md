#Project 3 - Physical Therapy App

#User Stories/Scope:
App Goal: Allow the user and the physician to communicate and interact online

There are two users : patient and doctor.

Patient: the patient will be able to log in/sign up,  view the doctors, choose a doctor, view the list of exercises prescribed by the doctor, and the exercise index page
 
Doctors: the physician will be able to log in/sign up, to view the patient profile, assign/remove the exercises to the patient

We'll have three models: patients,  doctors and exercises. The patient and exercises are connected by a joint table
